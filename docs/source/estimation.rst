Estimation
==========

Here we will have estimation functions for the following types of models:

- maximum likelihood (ml)
- generalized method of moments (gmm)
- method of simulated moments (msm)
- indirect inference (ii)

Most of these functions will just construct a criterion frunction from some building blocks and then call our minimize function. We will only start to write them after
the optimization tools are completed.
