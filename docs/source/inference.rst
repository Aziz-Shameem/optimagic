Inference
=========


Here we will have standard error functions for the following types of models:

- maximum likelihood (ml)
- generalized method of moments (gmm)
- method of simulated moments (msm)
- indirect inference (ii)

We will only start to write them after the corresponding estimate functions are ready.
